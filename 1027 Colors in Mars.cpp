/*1027 Colors in Mars
People in Mars represent the colors in their computers in a similar way as the Earth people. That is, a color is represented by a 6-digit number,
 where the first 2 digits are for Red, the middle 2 digits for Green, and the last 2 digits for Blue. 
 The only difference is that they use radix 13 (0-9 and A-C) instead of 16. 
 Now given a color in three decimal numbers (each between 0 and 168), you are supposed to output their Mars RGB values.
Input Specification:
Each input file contains one test case which occupies a line containing the three decimal color values.
Output Specification:
For each test case you should output the Mars RGB value in the following format: first output #, then followed by a 6-digit number where all the English characters must be upper-cased.
 ×¢Òâ£ºIf a single color is only 1-digit long, you must print a 0 to its left.
outnumber = a*13^1+b*13^0;
